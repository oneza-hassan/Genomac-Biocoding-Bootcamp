# Genomac Biocoding Bootcamp Practice

This repository contains my documented practice and learning materials from the **Genomac Biocoding Bootcamp**. It includes work in both Python and R, along with helpful resources.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Python Work
- **Location:** `Python_work/`
- **Contents:** 
  - Jupyter notebook files covering Python essentials for bioinformatics

### 2. R Work
- **Location:** `R_work/`
- **Key Contents:**
  - `R_class/`: Fundamentals of R programming
  - Special setup for using R on a secondary drive (non-default) to manage storage issues with large library downloads

### 3. Resources
- **Location:** `resources/`
- **Contents:** 
  - PDF files and reference materials from the bootcamp

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal learning record
- A reference for bioinformatics coding concepts
- Storage for bootcamp materials

## Note
The R setup includes special configuration to handle library storage efficiently by using an alternative drive location rather than the default system drive.
